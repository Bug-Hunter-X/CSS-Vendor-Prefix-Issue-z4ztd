This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle CSS bug involving unsupported vendor prefixes. The `bug.css` file contains CSS code with outdated prefixes, resulting in styling inconsistencies across different browsers. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected code without unnecessary prefixes.  This example highlights the importance of keeping CSS code up-to-date and avoiding unnecessary vendor prefixes for better cross-browser compatibility.
